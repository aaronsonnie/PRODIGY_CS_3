# Password Complexity Checker
This Python program evaluates the strength of a password based on several criteria, providing feedback to users on the password's complexity.

# Features
Length Check: Ensures the password is at least 8 characters long.
Uppercase Check: Verifies the presence of at least one uppercase letter.
Lowercase Check: Verifies the presence of at least one lowercase letter.
Number Check: Verifies the presence of at least one numeric digit.
Special Character Check: Verifies the presence of at least one Special character (e.g., !@#$%^&*()).
Feedback: Provides a summary of the password's strength and specific recommendations for improvement.

# How It Works
The program uses regular expressions to check for the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It sums up the number of criteria met to determine the password strength and provides feedback accordingly.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
