# Password Complexity Checker
This Python program assesses the strength of a password by evaluating it against several criteria, offering feedback on the password's complexity.

# Features
Length Check: Confirms the password is at least 8 characters long.
Uppercase Check: Ensures there is at least one uppercase letter.
Lowercase Check: Ensures there is at least one lowercase letter.
Number Check: Confirms the presence of at least one numeric digit.
Special Character Check: Verifies the inclusion of at least one special character (e.g., !@#$%^&*()).
Feedback: Provides a detailed summary of the password's strength along with specific recommendations for improvement.

# How It Works
The program uses regular expressions to detect the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It calculates the total number of criteria met to evaluate the password's strength and provides appropriate feedback.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
